## üìñ Overview

Urban traffic congestion causes serious problems like delays, fuel wastage, and pollution. This project leverages **Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)** communication and **LSTM-based AI prediction** to provide real-time congestion forecasting and route optimization.

It uses **SUMO** for traffic simulation and dynamically calculates the best paths using live and historical data. The system is visualized through an interactive **web-based GUI** and responds to traffic conditions in real-time.

## üöó Key Features

- Real-time traffic monitoring using **V2I communication**
- **AI model** (LSTM) to predict congestion patterns with ~90% accuracy
- **Dynamic rerouting** of vehicles using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Traffic simulation with **OpenStreetMap + SUMO**
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring live vehicle data, congestion stats, and rerouting
- Scalable and modular backend using Python + Flask
